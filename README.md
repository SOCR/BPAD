Overview
========

Biomedical Physics with Applications to Disease (BPAD) covers content, concepts, applcations and examples from University of Michigan Biophysics430/Physics430 (Medical Physics) and Biophysics440/Chemistry440 (Biophysics of Disease) courses.  The materials cover the fundamentals of physics of physiological processes (cardiovascular, muscular, neuronal and renal), physics-based therapies, and biomedical imaging. In addition, there are interactive modules demonstrating imaging techniques and medical physics based therapies will be elucidated in the context of the physical principles that are behind them. Imaging techniques include ultrasound, X-ray imaging, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, radiotherapy methods, data acquisition, modeling, analysis, visualizaiton, and interpretation. 

Code
====

The Rmd/R code is available and compiled into HTML5 dynamic content, see [html folder](https://github.com/SOCR/BPAD/tree/master/html).
